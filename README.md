# Coolname (We really need to find a cool name) 

Coolname is a tool for augmenting test suites of projects with specific focus on increasing coverage of third party API
calls.

## How it works

**Components**: Theo consists of a preprocessor, an api-finder, a coverage-checker and a test-generator(WIP).

- **Preprocessor** is maven plugin that creates a mapping of dependencies and package names at project build time. 
    This lets us identify all the package names of the dependencies used in the project. Currently, the format of the
    mapping is a simple text file with each line containing a package name and the corresponding dependency.
```json
{
  "org.bouncycastle.oer.its.etsi103097": [
    "org.bouncycastle:bcutil-jdk18on:jar:1.81"
  ],
  "org.mockito.internal.framework" : [ 
    "org.mockito:mockito-core:jar:5.19.0" 
  ]
}
```
  However, sometimes multiple dependencies could have a package with the same name. In these cases, the most accurate 
  way to determine the correct dependency is through dynamic analysis. At this stage, we just record all the dependency 
  names without trying to figure out which classes are actually loaded by the classloader.

- **API-finder** scans the source code of the project to identify all the third party API calls. It uses the mapping
  generated by the preprocessor to determine which package names belong to third party dependencies. The output is a 
  json list of all the third party API calls found in the source code in the following format (The format can be changed
  depending on the requirements for later steps).

```json
{
  "thirdPartyPaths" : [
    {
      "entryPoint": "org.apache.pdfbox.io.RandomAccessReadView.read",
      "thirdPartyMethod": "org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getLogger",
      "thirdPartyPackage": "org.apache.logging.log4j",
      "path": [
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.RandomAccessReadView.read",
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFileBuffer.read",
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFileBuffer.ensureAvailableBytesInPage",
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFileBuffer.addPage",
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFile.getNewPage",
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFile.enlarge",
        "org.apache.pdfbox.io.ScratchFile.<clinit>",
        "org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getLogger"
      ]
    }, {
      "entryPoint" : "org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.encryption.SecurityProvider.getProvider",
      "thirdPartyMethod" : "org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider.<init>",
      "thirdPartyPackage" : "org.bouncycastle.jce.provider",
      "path" : [ "org.apache.pdfbox.pdmodel.encryption.SecurityProvider.getProvider", "org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider.<init>" ]
    } ]
}
```

 - **Coverage-checker** takes the list of third party API calls and checks the test suite to see if there are any tests
   that cover these API calls. It uses code coverage reports generated by the JaCoCo plugin to determine which lines of 
   code are covered by the tests. The output is a json list of all the third party API calls that are covered/not covered
   by any tests in the following format.

```json
{
  "total" : 4,
  "covered" : 1,
  "notCovered" : 3,
  "coveragePercent" : 25.0,
  "coveredMethods" : [ {
    "method" : "org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager.getLogger",
    "entryPoint" : "org.apache.pdfbox.io.RandomAccessRead.peek"
  } ],
  "notCoveredMethods" : [ {
    "method" : "org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.debug",
    "entryPoint" : "org.apache.pdfbox.io.IOUtils.closeQuietly"
  }, {
    "method" : "org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.warn",
    "entryPoint" : "org.apache.pdfbox.io.RandomAccessRead.peek"
  }, {
    "method" : "org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger.error",
    "entryPoint" : "org.apache.pdfbox.io.RandomAccessInputStream.read"
  } ]
}
```

 - **Test-generator** (WIP) will take the list of uncovered third party API calls and generate tests that cover these API
   calls. This is a work in progress and will be implemented in future versions.

## Usage

1. Clone and build the project (Java 17+ and Maven 3+ required)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogyagamage/coolname.git
mvn clean install
```

2. Run the preprocessor on your project

The parameter project (-Dproject) is not required if you run the plugin from the project directory.
```bash
mvn io.github.chains-project:theo-preprocessor-maven-plugin:1.0-SNAPSHOT:preprocess -DoutputFile=path/to/output/file.json
 -Dproject=path/to/your/project
```

3. Run the api-finder on your project

```bash
java -jar path/to/api-finder/target/api-finder-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar process -m path/to/preprocessor/output/file.json -p package.name -j path/to/project/jar/with/dependencies 
```

Here, -t is the path to the preprocessor output file and -j is the path to the jar of the project under analysis. 
The project jar should contain all the dependencies packaged as well.

4. Run the coverage-checker on your project

```bash
java -jar path/to/coverage-checker/target/coverage-checker-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar check -t path/to/api-finder/output/file.json -j path/to/project/target/site/jacoco 
```

Here, -t is the path to the api-finder output file and -j is the path to the JaCoCo report directory. If Jacoco reports
do not exist please run the tests with [JaCoCo enabled](https://www.eclemma.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/maven.html) first.

## Future work
- Add support to process mutation testing reports generated by [PIT](https://pitest.org/)
    - Check how to identify thrid party API coverage from PIT reports
    - Modify the coverage-checker to process PIT reports 
- Implement the test-generator component to generate tests for uncovered third party API calls.
    - Select an appropriate LLM by referring to related work
    - Deploy the LLM 
    - Experiment with different prompt engineering techniques
    - Implement a feedback loop to improve the generated tests
    - Integrate the best approach into the toolchain
- Evaluate the tool on a set of open source projects
    - Select a set of open source projects that use third party dependencies
    - Run the tool on these projects and measure the increase in coverage of third party API calls
    - Analyze the results
- Write tests for this project :)
